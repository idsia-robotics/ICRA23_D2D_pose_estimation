# Ultra-low Power Deep Learning-based Monocular Relative Localization Onboard Nano-quadrotors

Here you can find the links for the three supplementary videos mentioned in our paper.  
In all of them, we set the same target relative pose for these 'lock and hold' tests: [0.8, 0.0, 0.0] for x,y and z (in meters).
